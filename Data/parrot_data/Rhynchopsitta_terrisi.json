Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). During winter 1998, some birds were recorded in the Sierra Gorda, Quer\u00e9taro (R. Pedraza in litt. 1998), suggesting wanderers reach the south of the Sierra Madre Oriental. By 1998, 21 colonies had been identified (Snyder and Enkerlin 1996, Macias Caballero 1998), with 23 known by 2006 (Ortiz-Maciel et al. 2006), but it is still unclear whether it breeds c.25 km south of that range at Cerro Potos\u00ed. Counts of large wintering aggregations and productivity data from 1996 to 2007 suggest that the known colonies could account for almost the entire breeding population (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). There are four main colonies (El Taray, El Condominio, San Antonio de la Osamenta and Santa Cruz [Macias Caballero 1998], with El Taray the most important [Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a and Ortiz Maciel 2007]). Population estimates are hampered by its seasonal movements, but numbers were put at 2,500-3,000 individuals in 1996 (Macias Caballero 1998), and c.2,500 individuals following surveys in 2006-2007 (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). An estimate of c.3,500 individuals was put forward in 2008 (Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. 2008); however, given that the species is thought to reach reproductive maturity at around four years, there are probably fewer than 2,500 mature individuals (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). Comparisons with the 1,400 and 1,600 birds estimated in the 1970s indicate that population levels were relatively stable up until the mid-1990s (Snyder and Enkerlin 1996, Macias Caballero 1998). However, numbers of breeding pairs at known colonies have been declining, there is poor breeding success and the species's habitat is being destroyed (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). It appears that less than 10% of the population is breeding successfully each year (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010).

The species is protected by Mexican law; formerly considered 'threatened' in Mexico, its status was recently revised to Endangered (SEMARNAT 2010). In October 2008, a bill was signed into law banning the capture and export of Mexican wild parrots (Pham 2008). The El Taray Sanctuary encompasses 3.5 km2 of habitat (Macias Caballero 1998) and was set up in 1995 with the main aim of preserving this species (Marroqu\u00edn-Flores 2004). However, this is not effectively protected (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). A conservation plan has been put in effect, focusing on the main colony of El Condominio, including effective protection of 15 km2 through contracts with individual land-owners and owners of ejidos (communally owned land) (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). Significant numbers breed in Cumbres de Monterrey National Park, but this is not effectively protected (Macias Caballero 1998, C. Macias Caballero and E. C. Enkerlin-Hoeflich in litt. 1999). Since 1995, nesting has been monitored at the 23 known breeding colonies (Ortiz-Maciel et al. 2006, R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). Plans had been made in 2006 to involve local people in the restoration of areas affected by fires, wildlife monitoring and the prevention of soil erosion (Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a and Ortiz Maciel 2007). There are no protected sites in the species's wintering areas (Ortiz-Maciel et al. 2006), but conservation efforts include future projects for the protection of 80 km2 of forest (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010).  Captive breeding populations exist although no breeding success has yet been acheived (Reinschmidt 2013).\nConservation Actions Proposed\nProtect all nesting colonies and wintering areas (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). Conduct surveys to search for undiscovered colonies and extend captive breeding efforts. Monitor rates of habitat loss and degradation throughout its range. Actively control fires. Restore habitat affected by fires (Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a and Ortiz Maciel 2007). Determine precise habitat usage (Macias Caballero 1998). Implement a permanent environmental education programme for local communities (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). Develop alternative sustainable activities for local people in order to decrease pressure on habitat (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010, Ortiz-Maciel et al. 2010).\n"}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": ["Droughts", "Annual & perennial non-timber crops", "Small-holder farming", "Livestock farming & ranching", "Small-holder grazing, ranching or farming", "Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals", "Intentional use (species is the target)", "Gathering terrestrial plants", "Unintentional effects (species is not the target)", "Logging & wood harvesting", "Unintentional effects: (large scale) [harvest]", "Fire & fire suppression", "Trend Unknown/Unrecorded"], "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": ["Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)"], "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": ["Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing"], "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": ["Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines"], "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null], "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "Intensive grazing and agricultural conversion have destroyed and degraded forest (Snyder et al. 1996, Macias Caballero 1998). Annual fires burn large areas (in 1998, 20 km2 of foraging habitat were lost [G\u00f3mez-Garza and Garza-Tob\u00f3n 1998], and 20 km2 of pine forest, including 90% of El Taray Sanctuary, were lost to two wildfires in 2005-2006 [Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a and Ortiz Maciel 2007, R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010]), which regenerate as dense (and unsuitable) chaparral vegetation (Snyder et al. 1996, Macias Caballero 1998). Data suggest that between 1999 and 2008 more than 15,400 ha of pine forest in the species's breeding range were destroyed by wildfires (S. G. Ortiz-Maciel et al. in litt. 2010). Droughts fuel fires and dry up natural water sources (in 1994, at least 50 birds drowned whilst attempting to drink from a cement-walled water tank [Snyder et al. 2000]). Additionally, the species is affected by low pinion production, and pressure from local people who collect pinions as an alternative income source (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010). Forest is also cleared for timber extraction (Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a and Ortiz Maciel 2007). Climate change may also affect this species, as with a shift towards a drier environment may have a negative effect on breeding performance (Ortiz-Maciel et al. 2014), and could lead to the complete disappearance of this species's currently occupied habitat by 2090 (Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2015). The species is affected by some trapping and shooting (Ortiz-Maciel et al. 2006, Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a and Ortiz Maciel 2007) and may experience years of low breeding success (Ortiz-Maciel et al. 2006, 2014) or even zero recruitment (R. Vald\u00e9s-Pe\u00f1a et al. in litt. 2007, 2010).
