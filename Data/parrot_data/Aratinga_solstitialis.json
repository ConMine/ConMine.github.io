Suriname records from Sipaliwini Savanna (e.g. O'Shea 2004) refer to A. maculata (Collar et al. 2014). It is considered hypothetical in Venezuela on the basis of one sight record. Although it was fairly common until the 1970s in the  Rupununi-Roraima savannas of western Guyana and Roraima, it has since  suffered heavy trapping pressure and it is now very scarce or absent  across large parts of its former range. In Brazil it was recorded from the Mau river, Cont\u00e3o Cotingo river and Marac\u00e1 Ecological Station (M. Persio in litt. 2005) during the 1990s. Flocks of up to 12 birds have been recorded at the Terra Ind\u00edgena Raposa Serra do Sol, and along the road from Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n (Venezuela) to Boa Vista, 50 km south of the border. Birds have been frequently found (in flocks with &gt;15 individuals) at five localities inside S\u00e3o Marcos and Raposa/Serra do Sol indigenous lands (Laranjeiras et al. 2011). There are no recent records in all other localities in Brazil where the species was found in/before the 1990s, including at Marac\u00e1 Ecological Station, despite surveys in 2010 and despite local indications of its presence there in around 2000 (Laranjeiras et al. 2011). Several historic localities no longer contain dry foothill forest that the species apparently requires. In Guyana, evidence of nesting has been found in the Karasabai area where 50-80 individuals were seen in 2003, and c.25 km from this site there are fairly recent records from Karanambu (c. 30 km from the Brazilian border at Bonfim), and on the west bank of Demerara in 2006 (T. Arndt in litt. 2007, Guyana Amazon Tropical Birds Society in litt. 2007). More recently, flocks of up to 50 are reliably seen at Karasabai, with larger flocks regularly encountered along nearby Ireng River (C. J Sharpe in litt. 2016), e.g. a flock of c. 140 reported along Ireng River N of Lethem in October 2014 (Shaun Cartright [local river boatman / guide] verbally to C. J Sharpe, 4 Nov 2014). Since the early 1990s records are  limited to only nine localities, and there are thought to be fewer than  1,000 individuals in Brazil (T. Orsi and L. F. Silveira in litt. 2012).  The total population probably now numbers no more than a couple of  thousand  individuals at the very most, but probably fewer, with at  least 90% of these in Brazil, within a restricted, decreasing and  fragmented range (Laranjeiras et al. 2011).  One known flock in southern  Guyana is reported to number up to 200 individuals (Bergman 2009), with  other recent records from Roraima (Laranjeiras et al. 2011), suggesting that the total population numbers fewer than 2,500 mature individuals."}}, "population": {"population_size_in_country": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_size_globally": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_trend": {"value": "Decreasing", "unit": "unit"}, "population_notes": {"value": "One known flock in southern  Guyana is reported to number up to 200 individuals (Bergman 2009), with  other recent records from Roraima (Laranjeiras et al. 2011).
