Formerly widespread and locally abundant, it has declined rapidly. Virtually all recent records have been confined to Subic Bay Forest Reserve on Luzon, where it is still locally common. However, at two sites with records since 1980, Quezon National Park and Angat Dam, it now appears to be extinct, having been common at the former in the 1980s. There are no recent records from Marinduque, where it may already be extinct. It is believed extirpated from Bataan Natural Park  (where the area of old growth forest decreased by 65% between  1987/1993 and 2002), and apparently scarcer than in the early 1990s even  at its remaining stronghold at Subic Bay Forest Reserve (A. Jensen in litt. 2013).  It has been recorded at only seven out of 29 historic sites in the last  10 years; although possibly a function of poor coverage, it may more  likely represent a genuine range contraction (Espa\u00f1ola et al. 2013). Following surveys in 2009-2010 (Espa\u00f1ola et al. 2013), the total population is estimated to include fewer than 2,500 mature individuals with no more than 250 mature individuals in each sub-population.\n"}}, "population": {"population_size_in_country": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_size_globally": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_trend": {"value": "Decreasing", "unit": "unit"}, "population_notes": {"value": "Distance sampling along nearly 500\u2009km of line transects at 14 sites across Luzon in 2009-2010, then multiplying site-specific density estimates by reserve area, resulted in estimates of 246 individuals (95% CI: 42-1,434) in Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park, and 174 (95% CI: 80-380) in Subic Bay Forest Reserve/Bataan Natural Park (Espa\u00f1ola et al. 2013). The data therefore suggest that there are fewer than 250 mature individuals in each of the two main remaining sub-populations and imply that the total population could include fewer than 2,500 mature individuals.

Conservation Actions Proposed\nConduct surveys to identify further sites supporting key populations, with a view to formally establishing them as protected areas (e.g. Mts Cagua, Cetaceo and the Mariveles Mountains). Research its ecology and year-round requirements, to improve understanding of its management needs. Examine trends in Prioniturus species at all sites to monitor the spread of the apparently invasive P. discurus. Improve protection measures against logging at Subic Bay Forest Reserve. Clamp down on illegal logging within the species's range, and ensure that environmental impact assessments are carried out before any new logging concessions are granted. Establish a captive breeding population to support future reintroduction and supplementation efforts. Lobby against proposed developments that threaten suitable habitat.\n"}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "Trapping for the cage-bird trade is a significant problem. Local extinctions as a direct result of forest loss are very likely. In 1988, forest cover was just 3% on Marinduque and 24% on Luzon. Forest cover in the Sierra Madre mountains has declined by 83% since the 1930s. Most remaining areas are under logging concession and may suffer further from major road-building plans. A road development near Subic Bay has increased the incidence of illegal logging and felling is rife at Maria Aurora Memorial Natural Park. Habitat modification may have accentuated interspecific competition, with the species having been replaced by Blue-crowned Racquet-tail P. discurus in Quezon National Park. It appears that the Green Racquet-tail might now only occur in two areas of   Luzon and that Subic Bay might be the only one with any protection (R.   Hutchison in litt. 2013).
