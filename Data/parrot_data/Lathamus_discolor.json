After breeding, birds disperse throughout Tasmania before migrating north to mainland Australia. In most years, a large portion of the population winters in central Victoria, with a smaller number of birds wintering further afield (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). However during periods of extreme drought in central Victoria, Swift Parrots undertake large-scale movements (up to 1,000 km) to drought refuge habitats in wetter coastal areas of New South Wales (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Small flocks are recorded in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory on a regular basis (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). The range in South Australia appears to have contracted, with only irregular recent records of small flocks or individual birds from the south-east of the state. Population size and trends are poorly known.\n\nIn 1987-1988, the breeding population was estimated at 5,000 birds, including 1,320 breeding pairs, and in 1995-1996, at 940 breeding pairs (Brereton 1996). Annual surveys across the non-breeding range fluctuate depending on the distribution of the birds across the landscape and flock sizes (Garnett et al. 2011). In 2010 mainland surveys recorded 2,158 birds, including immatures, the highest count for many years (C. Tzaros and D. Ingwersen in litt. 2010). Garnett et al. (2011) estimate that the population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining, however a population viability analysis model predicted that the population will decline by an average of 87% (79-95%) over three generations (12-18 years) (Heinsohn et al. 2015)."}}, "population": {"population_size_in_country": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_size_globally": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_trend": {"value": "Decreasing", "unit": "unit"}, "population_notes": {"value": "Garnett et al.

Management actions completed or underway include regular population surveys in Tasmania and throughout the mainland range, utilising a large network of volunteers (Saunders et al. 2007) (coordinated by the Swift Parrot Recovery Team and the Threatened Bird Network), addition of areas of critical habitat to the conservation reserve system in Victoria, development and refinement of guidelines for forestry in E. globulus and box-ironbark forests (at identified priority sites), development of community awareness programmes and revegetation and habitat rehabilitation. BirdLife Australia are calling for an immediate halt to logging activities in important breeding habitat for the species (Vine 2015).\n\nConservation and Research Actions Proposed\nEstablish an annual monitoring programme to determine trends and breeding distribution under different climatic conditions. Urgently conduct research to determine methods of reducing Sugar Glider predation on Swift Parrot nests. Conduct research on nesting distribution, breeding success and population viability. Identify nesting and foraging sites and migration routes and map these using GIS. Monitor the extent of habitat loss and alteration surrounding known sites. Develop a habitat phenology monitoring project. Place all areas of public land that support Swift Parrots under secure  conservation management, particularly those in timber reserves,  transport corridors and local government land. Promote revegetation and land reclamation that recreates woodland habitat. Establish incentive, conservation and management agreement and community projects each year for the protection, restoration or conservation management of habitat. Provide recommendations for the revision of threatened fauna manuals and forestry prescriptions when licence agreements are due for renewal in each state. Provide conservation information to key Local Government Areas.  Engage the public in research, monitoring, management and advocacy. Produce spatial and temporal climate change models, review the potential influence of climate change on the species and identify future management strategies. Establish and maintain a collision database. Produce and distribute collision prevention brochures. Produce media releases each year for increased public awareness. Develop a monitoring protocol for Psittacine beak and feather disease and distribute information to all fauna rescue and state conservation organizations.\n\n"}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": ["Housing & urban areas", "Habitat shifting & alteration", "Annual & perennial non-timber crops", "Agro-industry farming", "Wood & pulp plantations", "Agro-industry plantations", "Roads & railroads", "Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals", "Intentional use (species is the target)", "Logging & wood harvesting", "Unintentional effects: (large scale) [harvest]", "Work & other activities", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Bombus terrestris)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Petaurus breviceps)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Sturnus vulgaris)", "Named species (Bombus terrestris)", "Named species (Petaurus breviceps)", "Named species (Sturnus vulgaris)", "Problematic native species/diseases (Unspecified MELIPHAGIDAE)", "Named species (Unspecified MELIPHAGIDAE)", "Viral/prion-induced diseases", "Named species"], "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": ["Majority (50-90%)", "Whole (>90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)"], "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": ["Ongoing", "Future", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing"], "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": ["Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Negligible declines", "Unknown", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Unknown", "Unknown", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Unknown", "Unknown", "Unknown", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines"], "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": ["Medium Impact: 6", "Low Impact: 5", "Medium Impact: 6", "Medium Impact: 6", "Medium Impact: 6", "Medium Impact: 6", "Medium Impact: 6", "Low Impact: 4", "Low Impact: 4", "Medium Impact: 6", "Medium Impact: 6", "Low Impact: 4", "Unknown", "Medium Impact: 6", "Unknown", "Unknown", "Medium Impact: 6", "Unknown", "Unknown", "Unknown", "Low Impact: 4", "Low Impact: 4"], "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "Nest predation by Sugar Gliders Petaurus breviceps introduced to Tasmania poses a severe threat (Stojanovic et al. 2014) and is estimated to cause severe declines over the next three generations (Heinsohn et al. 2015). Surveys revealed that Sugar Gliders predated nests and the probability of a nest surviving the 60-day nesting period when Sugar Gliders were present was 0.17 (Stojanovic et al. 2014). On mainland Tasmania almost 79% nests were predated and 65% of adult females were killed by Sugar Gliders. Predation was most severe in locations with low forest cover. Owing to the fact that Swift Parrot breeding distribution varies widely between years the extent of nest predation is also expected to vary annually depending on the distribution of Sugar Gliders and forest cover. Sugar Gliders have not been reported from Bruny Island, a Swift Parrot breeding site.\n\nHabitat loss and alteration within breeding and drought refuge habitats remains a key threat. In Tasmania, breeding habitat is significantly reduced and fragmented through clearance of E. globulus for agriculture, residential development, plantation timber, sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips. In 2017, a large area of key nesting habitat has been logged for timber extraction (D. Stojanovic in litt. 2017). Over 50% of the original grassy E. globulus forest in Tasmania has been cleared (Brereton et al. 2004). Selective logging has resulted in the removal of larger trees from the remaining forest patches. Such patches are typically unfenced and exhibit poor regeneration (Brereton et al. 2004). Competition for remaining nest-sites with Common Starlings Sturnus vulgaris could be a problem along forest edges. Even with protection of remaining habitat (80% private land), maintenance and recovery may be limited by the dependence of breeding on an irregular nectar supply. It also suffers high mortality through collision with windows, vehicles and fences. On the mainland, clearance and degradation of habitat for agriculture, forestry and residential and commercial development has had the biggest impact (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Much of the preferred lowland habitat on the most fertile and productive sites has been cleared or substantially modified (C. Tzaros in litt. 2003). Drought refuge habitats continue to be cleared and fragmented for coastal developments (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Remnants, including much of what currently exists in the conservation reserve system, have been heavily cut-over and degraded, and this practice is continuing in many areas, including hardwood production forests. This practice is considered to result in poor and unreliable nectar-sources through the reduction of large mature trees. Competition from large nectarivores honeyeaters and the introduced Bumblebee Bombus terrestris may be exacerbated by forest fragmentation. In winter, the species relies heavily on public land that has been exploited for timber, honey and minerals (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005). \n\nGlobal warming threatens to alter habitat phenology and climatic conditions such that habitat availability may be significantly reduced (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). The species is also threatened by disturbance, Psittacine beak and feather disease and illegal bird capture and trade (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Furthermore, the species seems to be very susceptible to Allee effects, where survival and reproductive success decline with decreasing population density, which might even accelerate the population decline (Crates et al. 2017)."}}}, "anage": {}, "eol": {"taxonomy": {"synonyms": {"value": "value"}, "taxonomic_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "iucn_status": {"red_list_category": {"value": "value"}, "historical_categories": {"value": ["pairs"]}, "red_list_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "habitat": {"habitats": ["forest", "woodland area", "terrestrial", "swamp", "coastal", "valley", "city", "plantation", "terrestrial habitat"], "countries_of_occurrence": {"value": ["South Pacific", "gazetteer php p details id australia"], "unit": "Extant in country"}, "introduced_range": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "native_range": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "endemicity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "range_trend": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "range_description": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "area_of_occupancy": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "extent_of_occurrence": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "range_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "population": {"population_size_in_country": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_size_globally": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_trend": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "life_history_traits": {"lifespan": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_lifespan": {"male": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "female": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}, "generation_time": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "sexual_maturity_age": {"male": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "female": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}, "clutch_size": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_interval": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "time_to_independence": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "hatching_time": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_season": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "bodymass": {"neonate_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "weaning_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "adult_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}}, "trade": {"year": {"value": "value"}, "appendix": {"value": "value"}, "importer": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "exporter": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "origin": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "imported_quantity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "exported_quantity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "term": {"value": "value"}, "unit": {"value": "value"}, "purpose": {"value": "value"}, "source": {"value": "value"}, "use_trade_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "conservation": {"management_practices": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "conservation_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "value"}}}}
