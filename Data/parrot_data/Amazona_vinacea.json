In the early 1980s, Paraguay was considered the global stronghold, but all remaining subpopulations in Canindey\u00fa, Alto Paran\u00e1, and Caaguaz\u00fa number fewer than c.200 birds  (Wege and Long 1995, Lowen et al. 1996, Cockle et al. 2007). The Itaip\u00fa reserves and Reserva Natural Privada Itab\u00f3 are key sites and the minimum remaining population in Paraguay has been estimated at 220 birds (Cockle et al. 2007). There are no recent records from Caazap\u00e1 or Concepci\u00f3n, and it has probably been extirpated in Amambay (where its historical occurrence is doubtful), Itap\u00faa and Guair\u00e1. It is perhaps most common in Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1 (several populations of more than 100 birds), southern Brazil, and low numbers persist in Minas Gerais and S\u00e3o Paulo, within an estimated national total of 1,500-2,000 birds (G. A. Bencke and A. E. Rupp in litt. 2009). It was possibly never common, and must be close to extinction in Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo and Rio de Janeiro. In Argentina, few populations remain in Misiones, and the species's stronghold is the mosaic of small farms and forest remnants between San Pedro and Santa Rosa (San Pedro Important Bird Area) (Bodrati et al. 2005), with two small additional populations near Campo Viera and Bernardo de Yrigoyen (Cockle et al. 2007). A 2016 census of all known localities in Argentina except Campo Viera yielded 262 - 314 individuals, with the Campo Viera estimated to number fewer than 20 (K. Cockle in litt. 2016). The availability of nest sites continues to decline in Argentina due to forest clearance (K. Cockle in litt. 2016).  A recent regional census, which was carried out simultaneously in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, counted a total which was similar to that observed during the previous project during 2013-2014, but smaller than that found by Cockle et al.

Considered nationally Vulnerable in Brazil (Urben-Filho et al. 2008, MMA 2014), and Critically Endangered in Argentina and Paraguay. Small populations occur in numerous protected areas (Wege and Long 1995, F. Olmos in litt. 1999). In Argentina, two small provincial parks are used by the species, but offer only partial protection because the parrots use habitat outside of the parks for most parts of their life cycle, including, critically, reproduction. In the species' Argentine stronghold between San Pedro and Santa Rosa, environmental education is underway to reduce capture of chicks, and the population has been monitored since 2005 (Proyecto Selva de Pino Paran\u00e1 in litt. 2007).  Successful breeding in captivity has occurred. In Paraguay, the population has been monitored at three remaining sites with Atlantic forest (A. Lesterhuis in litt. 2016). A census was recently carried out simultaneously in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay (A. Lesterhuis in litt. 2016).\nConservation Actions Proposed\nMonitor large populations (in March in Argentina). Study reproductive biology and demography throughout the species's distribution and develop structured captive breeding programmes to counteract the high level of poaching of wild populations. Protect General Carneiro (Santa Catarina), Itaip\u00fa (Alto Paran\u00e1), RNP Itab\u00f3 Rivas (Canindey\u00fa), Estancia Golondrina (Caaguaz\u00fa) and forest outside reserves in Rio de Janeiro (Snyder et al. 2000) and between San Pedro and Santa Rosa in Misiones. Invest in permanent trained rangers and resolve land tenure problems in Brazilian and Paraguayan reserves (F. Olmos in litt. 1999, Cockle et al. 2007). Enforce anti-trafficking laws on roads connecting Monte Pascoal National Park to south Brazil (Snyder et al. 2000), at sites where the species is captured, and on the borders and ports of Paraguay and Argentina. Raise local public awareness to curtail nest-robbing and promote conservation of nest sites. In Argentina, provide technical support to promote soil conservation, to avoid clearing of forest for crops on smallholder farms   "}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": ["Housing & urban areas", "Annual & perennial non-timber crops", "Annual & perennial non-timber crops", "Small-holder farming", "Agro-industry farming", "Mining & quarrying", "Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals", "Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals", "Intentional use (species is the target)", "Persecution/control"], "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": ["Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)"], "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": ["Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Past, Unlikely to Return", "Ongoing", "Past, Likely to Return", "Ongoing", "Past, Likely to Return"], "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": ["Slow, Significant Declines", "Rapid Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Rapid Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Rapid Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Rapid Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines"], "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null], "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "In 1984-1991, 38% of Paraguay's Atlantic forests disappeared (Huespe Fatecha et al. 1994), and range contractions in Brazil presumably result from similarly extensive deforestation. There is some correlation with the disappearance of Araucaria forest e.g. in Paran\u00e1, 73,780 km2 of Araucaria forest was reduced to 15,932 km2 in 1965 (Hueck 1978). Selective logging, colonisation and plantation agriculture threaten remaining forests (Dinerstein et al. 1995). However, in Argentina, Amazona vinacea has disappeared from large forest reserves (e.g. the 1,500 km2 Iguaz\u00fa-Urugua-\u00ed forest complex), remaining mostly in the mosaic of small farms and degraded forest remnants between San Pedro and Santa Rosa. There, where the wild population numbers approximately 200 individuals, 40 individuals were found in captivity in 35 homes between 2003 and 2005 (Cockle et al. 2007).   In 2006 and 2007, from twelve nests identified in this area, only one chick fledged; at least three nests were predated, at least two were flooded during storms, and at three nests the chicks were captured for sale to Brazil (Proyecto Selva de Pino Paran\u00e1 in litt. 2007). In the anthropogenic habitat that A. vinacea selects in Argentina, there appear to be few appropriate nest cavities, and most nests are in large, shallow, cavities which are easily predated or flooded during storms (Proyecto Selva de Pino Paran\u00e1 in litt. 2007). Furthermore, the species appears to be very conservative in selecting nest sites, returning year after year to cavities that continually fail (Proyecto Selva de Pino Paran\u00e1 in litt. 2007).  Interviews in 2015 - 2016 suggested that nest poaching continues to be a problem in Argentina (K. Cockle in litt. 2016).  Competition with other hole nesting animals may also be important: in the above mentioned nests in Argentina in 2007, A. vinacea apparently lost competitions for nest cavities with exotic honeybees, possums, and several species of hole-nesting birds, apparently during the incubation stage (Proyecto Selva de Pino Paran\u00e1 in litt. 2007). Internal trade has probably affected Brazilian and Argentine populations, and one massive bird-smuggling operation was centred in Paraguay and included A. vinacea (Endangered Species Bull. 1995 20[2]:7). The species was also shot as a crop pest in certain areas (White 1882, Chebez 1992), but this does not appear to be an important threat today (Cockle et al. 2007).\n"}}}, "anage": {}, "eol": {"taxonomy": {"synonyms": {"value": "value"}, "taxonomic_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "iucn_status": {"red_list_category": {"value": "value"}, "historical_categories": {"value": ["pairs"]}, "red_list_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "habitat": {"habitats": ["subtropical", "farm", "grassland", "terrestrial", "forest", "plateau", "tropical", "plantation"], "countries_of_occurrence": {"value": ["Brazil", "Argentina", "Paraguay", "South Atlantic"], "unit": "Extant in country"}, "introduced_range": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "native_range": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "endemicity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "range_trend": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "range_description": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "area_of_occupancy": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "extent_of_occurrence": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "range_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "population": {"population_size_in_country": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_size_globally": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_trend": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "life_history_traits": {"lifespan": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_lifespan": {"male": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "female": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}, "generation_time": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "sexual_maturity_age": {"male": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "female": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}, "clutch_size": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_interval": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "time_to_independence": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "hatching_time": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_season": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "bodymass": {"neonate_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "weaning_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "adult_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}}, "trade": {"year": {"value": "value"}, "appendix": {"value": "value"}, "importer": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "exporter": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "origin": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "imported_quantity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "exported_quantity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "term": {"value": "value"}, "unit": {"value": "value"}, "purpose": {"value": "value"}, "source": {"value": "value"}, "use_trade_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "conservation": {"management_practices": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "conservation_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "value"}}}}
