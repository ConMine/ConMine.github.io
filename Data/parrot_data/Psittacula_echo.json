From the 1970s to the mid-1980s the 10 or so known birds appeared to suffer almost total breeding failure. However, breeding subsequently began to be successful, and in 1993-1994 there were 16-22 birds. During the 1996-1997 breeding season there were 13 known wild pairs with a total of 50-61 birds present at the end of the breeding season restricted to an area of c.50 km2 contained within the 65.74 km2 Black River Gorges National Park in the south-west of the island (Jones and Swinnerton 1997). In 1998 the wild population stood at 59-73 birds, with 14 captive-bred or captive-reared birds having been released at Macchab\u00e9-Brise Fer since 1997 (Safford 1998). The rapid increase in population since 1995 is due primarily to intensive management of the wild population, the discovery of previously unknown breeding birds and an increase in the number of breeding groups that attempt to breed each year (Thorsen and Jones 1998). In the 1999/2000 season the population stood at 106-126 wild individuals (C. Jones in litt. 2000). Since that time the population continued to increase to 55 pairs (280-300 birds in the wild) in February 2005 (C. Jones in litt. 2005, Malham 2005). The 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 breeding seasons showed continued improvement (V. Tatayah in litt. 2006, Malham 2007), and in March 2006 the population was estimated at 309-335 in the wild (V. Tatayah in litt. 2006). Numbers fell to an estimated 290 birds by August 2006, probably due to Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) (V. Tatayah in litt. 2006), but recovered to over 500 birds in August 2010 (Jones 2010), with 129 young fledging in 2011/2012, and a known population of c.580 birds (V. Tatayah in litt. 2012). The species occupies only c.40 km2 of remnant native upland forest and uses only around 50% of this regularly (Thorsen et al. 1998).

The dramatic increase in the species's population in recent years is undoubtedly due to an intensive programme to manage the wild population combined with a highly successful captive breeding programme since the 1993/4 breeding season (Jones et al. 1998) - a collaborative effort of  the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, the World Parrot Trust, the Mauritian Government and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust Society (Greenwood 1996). Between 1997 and 2004, when reintroductions were completed, a total of 139 captive reared birds were released (Jones 2010). Intensive management includes nest site enhancement, provision of nest boxes (now more used than natural nests), supplementary feeding of some individuals, predator control around nest sites, control of nest competitors (P. krameri, rats, mynahs), control of nest parasites, close guarding and monitoring of all nests, rescue of eggs/young from failing nests, clutch manipulations (double clutching, exchanging infertile eggs with fertile ones), and brood manipulations (downbrooding, ie removing extra chicks from large broods and giving to foster parents) (C. Jones in litt. 2000,  Jones et al. 1998). All nest cavities are enhanced, modified and repaired as necessary, and measures taken to eliminate rats and parasites and prevent flooding (Jones et al. 1998). Habitat management has been directed at increasing the productivity of native forest and has included the foundation in 1993 of the Black River National Park in 6,574 ha of native forest (Jones and Hartley 1995, Greenwood 1996), including most of the species's remaining habitat (Jones et al. 1998). There are 14 Conservation Management Areas (CMAs), ranging from 0.2 to 24 ha, in which native forest is manually cleared of weeds (Jones et al. 1998). Some of these CMAs are heavily utilised by the species as their trees produce bumper crops (C. Jones in litt. 2000). Captive-reared birds have been released into the largest CMA, where problematic mammals are controlled (Jones et al. 1998). Research has occurred on present and historic genetic variation of the species so that the effects of the population bottleneck can be quantified and current populations managed to preserve maximum genetic diversity (Tollington et al. 2013). Research into the impact of PBFD is likely to be ongoing for several years (Malham 2007), and has involved intensive screening of birds since 2005 and several PhD studies (Richards 2010, V. Tatayah in litt. 2012). It now includes looking at whether birds which recover from the disease remain carriers and have the potential to pass it on to their offspring, and whether P. krameri may act as a reservoir for the disease (Richards 2010). Strict hygiene measures have been introduced to prevent species management spreading the disease (Richards 2010). Birds are fed supplemental food in the wild (V. Tatayah in litt. 2012).Conservation Actions Proposed\nEstablish additional populations in eastern Mauritius or Bambous Mountains as population in Black River National Park reaches carrying capacity, and consider reintroduction to R\u00e9union and possibly introduction to the Seychelles, where Psittacula wardi is extinct (C. Jones in litt. 2000, Jones et al. 2013). Improve nest site management (Thorsen et al. 1997, Swinnerton 1998). Continue to feed wild birds with supplementary food (Thorsen et al. 1997, Swinnerton 1998). Increase production of birds for release by controlling disease and improving diet of captive birds (Thorsen et al. 1997, Swinnerton 1998). Establish new, and improve existing (in part by the use of predator proof fencing (C. Jones in litt. 2000)) CMAs (Swinnerton 1998, C. Jones in litt. 2000). Further research the potential impacts of PBFD on the population, and the potential role of supplementary feeding in the spread of the disease (Richards 2010).\n"}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": ["Habitat shifting & alteration", "Storms & flooding", "Other threat", "Wood & pulp plantations", "Scale Unknown/Unrecorded", "Logging & wood harvesting", "Unintentional effects: (subsistence/small scale) [harvest]", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Acridotheres tristis)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Apis mellifera)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Ligustrum robustum)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Macaca fascicularis)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Psidium cattleianum)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Psittacula krameri)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Rattus rattus)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Rusa timorensis)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Sus scrofa)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Syzygium jambos)", "Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases (Unspecified Polistes)", "Unspecified species", "Named species (Acridotheres tristis)", "Named species (Apis mellifera)", "Named species (Ligustrum robustum)", "Named species (Macaca fascicularis)", "Named species (Psidium cattleianum)", "Named species (Psittacula krameri)", "Named species (Rattus rattus)", "Named species (Rusa timorensis)", "Named species (Sus scrofa)", "Named species (Syzygium jambos)", "Named species (Unspecified Polistes)", "Problematic native species/diseases (Phaethon lepturus)", "Named species (Phaethon lepturus)", "Viral/prion-induced diseases", "Named species"], "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": ["Whole (>90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", null, "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", null, "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)"], "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": ["Future", "Future", "Ongoing", "Past, Unlikely to Return", "Past, Unlikely to Return", "Past, Unlikely to Return", "Past, Unlikely to Return", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing"], "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": ["Unknown", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Very Rapid Declines", "Very Rapid Declines", "Very Rapid Declines", "Very Rapid Declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", null, "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", null, "Negligible declines", "Negligible declines", "Causing/Could cause fluctuations", "Causing/Could cause fluctuations"], "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": ["Unknown", "Low Impact: 3", "Low Impact: 5", "Past Impact", "Past Impact", "Past Impact", "Past Impact", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 3", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 3", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Medium Impact: 6", "Medium Impact: 6"], "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "This species's earlier decline and contracting distribution corresponds to the severe destruction and degradation of its native habitat (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996). The population crashed from a likely total of several thousand following forest destruction and the replacement of its favoured feeding habitat, upland dwarf forest, with plantations (Jones et al. 1998). In 1996, only 5% of the island was covered with native vegetation (Jones et al. 1998). The areas of upland native forest that remain continue to be highly degraded by cyclones, the influences of past forestry practices, the spread of introduced plants such as guava Psidium cattleianum, privet Ligustrum robustum and jamrosa Syzygium jambos and the effect of introduced feral mammals such as pigs Sus scrofa and rusa deer Rusa timorensis (Greenwood 1996, Thorsen and Jones 1998). The production of native fruit, on which the parakeet feeds, and regeneration of potential nest trees is thus poor (Greenwood 1996). Recent research suggests that food shortage due to deterioration of the native forest is the major cause of nest failure; although exotics can provide an abundant food source it is not available year-round or even throughout the breeding season (Thorsen and Jones 1998). Crab-eating macaques Macaca fascicularis and black rats Rattus rattus are amongst a number of introduced arboreal species which pose a threat to parakeets by raiding nests and competing for native fruits (Greenwood 1996). Bees Apis mellifera, yellow wasps Polistes hebraeus, paper wasps, termites, White-tailed Tropicbirds Phaethon lepturus, introduced Common Mynas Acridotheres tristis and Ring-necked Parakeets Psittacula krameri are all nest site competitors and can displace active breeding pairs (Thorsen and Jones 1998,  C. Jones in litt. 2000, V. Tatayah in litt. 2012). The decline in the number of old native trees, which are lost to storm damage and senescence, has intensified competition for nesting cavities, with 14-19% of P. eques cavities lost to competitors each year (Jones et al. 1998). Infestations of nest fly larvae can be severe in some years and, without intervention, would kill many young (C. Jones in litt. 2000). PBFD has been found in over 20% of sampled birds, and at least 50% of birds observed with PBFD are believed to have died, however a number of individuals have been seen to recover from the disease (Richards 2010).
