It has been extirpated from the western provinces (excluding Zapata) (Raffaele et al. 1998) and Isla de la Juventud, where it was once abundant. Recent studies of 14 populations have found that most populations are in serious decline (Snyder et al. 2000, Berovides &amp; Ca\u00f1izares, 2004). Even the population within Ci\u00e9naga de Zapata National Park appears to have declined, with recent surveys finding no flocks larger than 18 birds (Mitchell and Wells 1997, A.

A nest box provisioning scheme has been successfully developed in Lomas de Banao ecological reserve, Pico Juan ecological reserve and Hanabanilla. In these locations, most nesting attempts occur in artificial nest boxes.
