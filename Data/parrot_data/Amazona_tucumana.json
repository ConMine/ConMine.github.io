A recent study of the status and distribution of the species in Argentina recorded 6,015 individuals (Rivera et al. 2007), and estimated the Argentinian population to number c.10,000 bird, but around 20,000 individuals were exported from Argentina in the mid to late 1980s suggesting a substantial population decline may have occurred. After it was placed on Appendix I of CITES in response to this, international trade was effectively cut off, although local exploitation continues. However, it does not seem that populations have recovered, and habitat loss is of concern, particularly in Argentina where it is highly degraded and there are only a few small and isolated woodland remnants (L. Rivera in litt. 2004). Threats to habitat are less severe in Bolivia, but the species has declined there and is projected to continue to do so (A. Maccormick in litt. 2005). The main concentrations of this species in Bolivia occur in Montes Chapeados, Villa Serrano and Tariqu\u00eda Flora and Fauna National Reserve, with 1,643 individuals recorded at various sites during a recent study (Rivera et al. 2009). A dedicated national population census and monitoring initiative is required to provide an estimate of the Bolivian population and to locate, measure and monitor local populations and post-breeding roosts (A.

Effectively protect core areas of remaining habitat; review its habitat requirements, and supplement nest sites using boxes where appropriate (A. B. Hennessey in litt. 2012).

The species's population in Bolivia has apparently not recovered to its former levels (Rivera et al. 2009). Habitat in Argentina is highly degraded and consists of small, isolated fragments. The species's main nesting and feeding tree species are also targeted for logging by timber operations (L. Rivera in litt. 2011). In Bolivia, the regeneration of suitable forest is limited by burning to maintain extensive cattle grazing. Its habitat is also threatened by slash-and-burn agriculture and wildfires (Rivera et al. 2009, L. Rivera in litt. 2012).
