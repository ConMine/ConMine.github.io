Until 2002 it was known with certainty only from the type-series collected at Laguneta and Santa Isabel in 1911. There were several possible sightings between 1980 and 2000. In 1980 a group of Hapalopsittaca presumed to be of this species were observed at Santa Rosa de Cabal, Risaralda, and an individual was later reported in the same area in 2000 (Renjifo 2002). From 1989-1991 there were reports from Alto Quind\u00edo Acaime Natural Reserve and in the nearby Ca\u00f1on del Quind\u00edo Natural Reserve, Quind\u00edo. In 2000 there was a reported sighting between Ibague and Cajamarca, Tolima (Renjifo 2002). In July 2002, the first confirmed sighting was made in Cajamarca, Tolima, when 14 birds were located in a small area of forest (Parr and Gilardi 2002, Anon 2010). The species has also been recorded by Fundaci\u00f3n ProAves in montane forest in G\u00e9nova municipality, Quind\u00edo Department (Renjifo et al. 2014), where the largest group observed consisted of 25 birds and the total population in the El Mirador municipal reserve is estimated at approximately 60 individuals (Renjifo 2014). The total population is estimated to number less than 250 mature individuals (Renjifo 2014).\n"}}, "population": {"population_size_in_country": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_size_globally": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "population_trend": {"value": "Decreasing", "unit": "unit"}, "population_notes": {"value": "The total population is estimated to number less than 250 mature individuals (Renjifo 2002, 2014) and is placed here in the band 50-249 mature individuals."}}, "life_history_traits": {"lifespan": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_lifespan": {"male": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "female": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}, "generation_time": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "sexual_maturity_age": {"male": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "female": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}, "clutch_size": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_interval": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "time_to_independence": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "hatching_time": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "breeding_season": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "bodymass": {"neonate_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "weaning_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "adult_bodymass": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}}}, "trade": {"year": {"value": "value"}, "appendix": {"value": "value"}, "importer": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "exporter": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "origin": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "imported_quantity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "exported_quantity": {"value": "value", "unit": "unit"}, "term": {"value": "value"}, "unit": {"value": "value"}, "purpose": {"value": "value"}, "source": {"value": "value"}, "use_trade_notes": {"value": "NA"}}, "conservation": {"management_practices": {"value": ["Resource & habitat protection", "Site/area management", "Habitat & natural process restoration", "Awareness & communications"], "unit": "unit"}, "conservation_notes": {"value": "Conservation and Research Actions Underway\nCITES Appendix II. Considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Colombia (Renjifo et al. 2002, 2014). A series of reserves, known collectively as the Threatened Parrot Corridor, now protects approximately 70% of the species's population (more than 7,285 ha of key habitat) (Anon. 2012). It is protected in Alto Quindio Acaime and Ca\u00f1on del Quind\u00edo Natural Reserves, Los Nevados National Park and El Mirador municipal reserve. It occurs in the Paramos y Bosques Alto Andinos De Genova IBA, which was designated as a regional reserve in 2008 (Tovar-Martinez 2014). An area of 631 ha of core habitat was acquired by Fundaci\u00f3n ProAves with the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Loro Parque, American Bird Conservancy and IUCN Netherlands and is now managed as Loro Coroniazul Bird Reserve: surrounding municipality land is also being managed for the species (P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2008). Another protected area, the Giles-Fuertesi Bird Reserve located in Cajamarca, was recently created with the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Loro Parque and comprises nearly 300 ha at 3,200-3,700 m, including areas of cloud-forest (Anon. 2010, ABC 2012). This reserve will become a centre for research focussed on this species, including studies into its habitat use, behaviour and reproduction (Anon. 2010).\n\nThe Threatened Parrots of the Cordillera Central project has been working with local communities to restore degraded forest habitats and protect existing habitat (Anon. 2014a). Over 200 nest-boxes have been installed and have been very successful at allowing high breeding success (P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2008, Tovar Mart\u00ednez 2009, Forshaw and Knight 2017). A Species Conservation Plan was established in early 2008 (ProAves 2009), and since 2005 the ProAves 'Parrot Bus' has been raising awareness through environmental education programmes in rural communities of the central Andes. An annual Fuertes's Parrot Festival has also been established in G\u00e9nova (Anon. 2014a). There are no known individuals in captivity. \n\nConservation and Research Actions Proposed\nInvestigate the possibility that it occurs in Ucumari regional park. Monitor its population and research its ecological requirements to enable effective management of remaining habitat. Ensure the effective management of Alto Quind\u00edo Acaime Natural Reserve (Snyder et al. 2000) and El Mirador Municipality Nature Reserve. Acquire private properties with core breeding population and protect the species from expanding pasturelands. Work with local farmers and communities in raising awareness of the species's conservation and avoid possible trade of the species. Continue monitoring the population. Acquire and reforest pastureland with native trees."}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": ["Annual & perennial non-timber crops", "Small-holder farming", "Livestock farming & ranching", "Small-holder grazing, ranching or farming", "Mining & quarrying", "Logging & wood harvesting", "Unintentional effects: (large scale) [harvest]"], "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": ["Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)"], "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": ["Past, Unlikely to Return", "Past, Unlikely to Return", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Past, Unlikely to Return", "Ongoing", "Ongoing"], "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": ["Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines"], "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": ["Past Impact", "Past Impact", "Medium Impact: 6", "Medium Impact: 6", "Past Impact", "Medium Impact: 6", "Medium Impact: 6"], "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "Clearance of forest in the region of the type-locality was already extensive in 1911, and very little habitat now remains.
