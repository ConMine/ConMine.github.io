P. erithacus has a distribution extending from southeastern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire east through the moist lowland forests of West Africa to Cameroon, and thence in the Congo forests to just east of the Albertine Rift (up to the shores of Lake Victoria) in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, and south to northern Angola (Juniper and Parr 1998), as well as on the islands of Principe (Sao Tom\u00e9 and Principe) and Bioko (Equatorial Guinea). Preliminary calculations based on forest cover and country-level population estimates (D\u00e4ndliker 1992a, 1992b, Collar 1997, Fotso 1998a), subtracting estimates for P. timneh, suggest a global population of between 560,000 and 12.7 million individuals (Pilgrim et al. in prep.). Local population declines have been noted in Burundi, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Togo, Uganda, Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in the best documented instances such declines have been very severe (Martin et al. 2014, Tamungang et al. 2014). In all of these declines, trapping for the wild bird trade has been implicated, with habitat loss also potentially having significant impacts throughout West and East Africa. From 1982 to 2014, over 1.3 million wild-caught individuals of P. erithacus and P. timneh (the vast majority P. erithacus) entered international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2016). Considering estimates of pre-export mortality, and illegal trade, the number of birds extracted from the wild during this period may have exceeded this. Cameroon accounted for 48% of exports from 1990-1996 (Waugh 2010), and estimates that c.90% of trapped birds died before reaching Douala airport suggest, although quotas remained at 12,000, over 100,000 birds were being captured in Cameroon annually during this period (F.

In 1994, the P. e. princeps CITES listing was removed due to lack of evidence that it is a valid subspecies. Due to concern about the effects of the large numbers of this species traded, it was the subject of a CITES significant trade review, in which it was listed as of \"possible concern\" (Inskipp et al. 1988). The Animals Committee of CITES recommended a two-year ban from January 2007 in Cameroon. There have been multiple CITES Reviews of Significant Trade of this species, and together with additional trade restrictions this has resulted in reductions in international trade of this species (R. Martin in litt. 2016) and the species has now been moved to CITES Appendix I (S. Chng in litt. 2016). Only Cameroon has a published export quota (currently 3000 per annum) (R. Martin in litt. 2016). Until January 2016, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had a quota of 5,000 per annum, but this quota was not kept to and many people traded using false permits (CITES 2016). Monitoring of exploited areas and trapping sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in addition to outreach initiatives led by the provincial government has resulted in the protection of some of this species's largest breeding areas (Hart et al. 2016, R. Martin in litt. 2016). \nAn EU-CITES Capacity Building Project \u2018Strengthening Capacity for Monitoring and Regulation of International Trade of African Grey Parrots\u2019 was undertaken in 2013, involving participants from Liberia, Sierra Leone, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. This involved trials of monitoring parrot populations and trade, while it also developed a framework for the establishment of national management plans of this species (R. Martin in litt. 2016). The species occurs in a number of protected areas.Conservation Actions Proposed\nEstablish institutional structures for regulation of trade and scientifically robust methods for establishing non-detrimental levels of exploitation (R. Martin in litt. 2016). Ensure that proposed trade restrictions are implemented. Monitor wild populations to determine ongoing trends. Extend captive breeding efforts (Collar and Butchart 2013) to both meet avicultural demands and assist with reintroduction and supplementation efforts. Develop protocols for management of parrots confiscated from trade (R. Martin in litt. 2016)."}}, "threats": {"threats": {"value": ["Annual & perennial non-timber crops", "Small-holder farming", "Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals", "Intentional use (species is the target)", "Logging & wood harvesting", "Unintentional effects: (subsistence/small scale) [harvest]"], "unit": "unit"}, "scope": {"value": ["Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Majority (50-90%)", "Minority (<50%)", "Minority (<50%)"], "unit": "unit"}, "timing": {"value": ["Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing", "Ongoing"], "unit": "unit"}, "severity": {"value": ["Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Rapid Declines", "Rapid Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines", "Slow, Significant Declines"], "unit": "unit"}, "score": {"value": ["Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5", "Medium Impact: 7", "Medium Impact: 7", "Low Impact: 5", "Low Impact: 5"], "unit": "unit"}, "threats_notes": {"value": "It is one of the most popular avian pets in Europe, the United States,  and the Middle East due to its longevity and unparalleled ability to  mimic human speech and other sounds. Demand for wild birds is also  increasing in China, and increased presence of Chinese businesses in  central Africa (particularly for mining, oil and logging) may increase  illegal exports of this species (F. Maisels in litt. 2006, H. Rainey in litt. 2006). From 1982 to 2001, over 1.3 million wild-caught individuals of both erithacus and timneh (the vast majority erithacus) entered international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2016), and considering the pre-trade mortality can be 30-66% (Fotso 1998a, b, McGowan 2001, Hart 2013), the number collected could far exceed this figure (Martin et al. 2014, R. Martin in litt. 2016). During 1984 \u2013 1992, more than 50,000 individual wild birds were traded annually (UNEP-WCMC 2016). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cameroon exported an annual quota of 10,000 birds; estimates that c.90% of trapped birds died before reaching Douala airport suggest that some 100,000 birds per year were being captured in Cameroon during that period (F. Dowsett-Lemaire in litt. 2012).  Official statistics give exports of 367,166 individuals from Cameroon in the period 1981-2005, and the country accounted for 48% of exports between 1990-1996 (Waugh 2010). Up to 10,000 wild-caught birds from the Democratic Republic of the Congo  are apparently imported into South Africa each year (S. Boyes in litt. 2011). There has been a reduction in the trade of this species, partly due to extra trade restrictions, but also due to population declines, which leads collectors to move onto populations previously not harvested (R. Martin in litt. 2016). The majority of legal exports are now from central Africa, and difficulties regulating trade mean that quotas have been regularly exceeded (CITES 2016). In addition, illegal international trafficking occurs but levels are difficult to quantify (R. Martin in litt. 2016).\nBecause the species concentrates in traditional nesting, roosting, drinking and mineral lick sites, it is especially vulnerable to trapping pressure. Habitat loss is undoubtedly having significant impacts, particularly throughout West and East Africa. In addition to capture for international trade, there is an active internal trade in live birds for pets and exhibition (McGowan 2001, Clemmons 2003, A. Michels in litt. 2012). The species is also hunted in parts of the range as bushmeat and to supply heads, legs and tail feathers for use as medicine or in black magic (Fotso 1998a, McGowan 2001, Clemmons 2003, A. Michels in litt. 2012).  \nForest loss is also negatively impacting populations, and is considered to have contributed to declines in Ghana and may be a larger threat than the pet trade in Cameroon (Tamungang and Cheke 2012, Annorbah et al. 2016). The loss of large trees with nesting cavities may be particularly detrimental. Although some observers have noted populations are associated with primary forest (D\u00e4ndliker 1992, Juste 1996, Clemmons 2003), permanent populations in semi-urban areas, and its frequent use of farm-bush, plantations and secondary forest suggest this species may be robust to some habitat change (Tamungang and Cheke 2012, R. Martin in litt. 2014)."}}}, "anage": {"taxonomy": {"synonyms": {"value": "value"}, "taxonomic_notes": {"value": "value"}}, "iucn_status": {"red_list_category": {"value": "value"},
