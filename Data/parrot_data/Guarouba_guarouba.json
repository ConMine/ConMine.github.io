It is considered Vulnerable at the national level in Brazil (Silveira and Straube 2008, MMA 2014), and protected under Brazilian law (and has been proposed as the national bird of Brazil). A campaign tackling bird trade in Bolivia may help curtail international trade (A. B. Hennessey in litt. 2009). A population is relatively well-protected in Tapaj\u00f3s National Park, and a remnant population may survive in Gurupi Biological Reserve. Jamari National Forest is poorly protected and suffers constant pressure from squatters, loggers and poachers (F. Olmos in litt. 1999). Conservation of this species in reserves is problematic because of its apparent nomadism.\n\nConservation Actions Proposed\nConduct surveys to search for previously unknown populations, especially in the south and west of its range. Ensure the de facto protection of Gurupi Biological Reserve. Maintain the integrity of Tapaj\u00f3s National Park. Protect and manage land between existing protected areas to facilitate nomadic movements. Enforce legal restrictions on trade, especially in internal markets. Further develop the captive breeding programme.

Selective logging of primary hardwoods removes suitable roosting and nesting cavities (Yamashita 2003). However, the species is not as forest-dependent as several other  non-threatened Psittacid species in the region, and it is capable of  commuting between  multiple forest-patches and moving around non-forest  landscapes (A. C. Lees in litt. 2013). In addition, the majority of remaining suitable habitat is not as   fragmented as originally thought and much of this is under  protection  (de Luca et  al. 2009). Nevertheless, projected rates of deforestation within its range, based on forecasts of infrastructure development (Soares-Filho et al. 2006), suggest that the species will be impacted over the coming decades (Bird et al. 2011). It has been extensively trapped for trade, but, although some illegal trade persists, this is no longer a major concern as trade is now usually within the substantial captive population, and does not have a significant impact on the wild population (L. F. Silveira in litt. 2012, A. C.
